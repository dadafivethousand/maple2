          <h2>What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)?</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art that focuses on ground fighting and submissions. It emphasizes leverage, technique, and strategy over brute strength, making it highly effective for people of all sizes. BJJ gained worldwide recognition after winning the first UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), demonstrating its effectiveness against other martial arts.

          <h2>What are the belts in BJJ, and how long does it take to get a black belt?</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          <p>
            BJJ has a belt system that progresses from white to black: White, Blue, Purple, Brown, and Black. It takes years of consistent training to progress through the ranks, and earning a black belt typically takes around 10-15 years, depending on your dedication, effort, and progression.

          <h2>Why is hygiene important in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?</h2>
        </div>
        <div className="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Since BJJ is a contact sport, maintaining proper hygiene is crucial for the safety and comfort of everyone on the mat. Students should come to class with clean attire, trimmed nails, and a clean body to prevent the spread of germs and infections. It is also important to clean and wash your Gi or No-Gi clothing after every class.
