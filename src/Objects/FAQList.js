    question: "Why choose Maple BJJ?",
    answer:
      "Because we offer a complete combat-sports pathway for all levels. Our coaches teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (Gi and No-Gi), Muay Thai striking, Wrestling, and MMA integration in a clean, welcoming space. Whether your goal is fitness, self-defense, or competition, we’ll help you progress safely and consistently."
  },

  {
    question: "What’s the difference between BJJ, Muay Thai, MMA, and Wrestling?",
    answer:
      "BJJ focuses on grappling—takedowns, control, and submissions—using technique over strength. Muay Thai is a striking art using punches, kicks, knees, and elbows with clinch work. Wrestling emphasizes takedowns, pressure, and top control from the feet to the mat. MMA blends striking and grappling for a well-rounded skill set. Many members cross-train to build complete fundamentals."
  },


  {
    question: "I’m a complete beginner. Where should I start?",
    answer:
      "You can start in any of our beginner-friendly classes. New students often begin with BJJ Fundamentals or Muay Thai Fundamentals, and you can add Wrestling once you’re comfortable with the basics. Coaches will guide you to the right first class and pace."
  },

  {
    question: "How often should I train as a beginner?",
    answer:
      "Two to three classes per week is perfect to build a foundation without overtraining. As your conditioning and technique improve, you can add sessions or cross-train across programs."
  },

  {
    question: "Is training safe? Is sparring required?",
    answer:
      "Safety is our top priority. We emphasize proper technique, controlled partner work, and mutual respect. Sparring/rolling is optional for beginners and always supervised; you can focus on drills and technique until you’re ready."
  },

  {
    question: "Do women train here?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We’re committed to an inclusive, respectful environment. Women of all experience levels train in BJJ, Muay Thai, Wrestling, and MMA here—many start with fundamentals and progress at their own pace."
  },

  {
    question: "What gear do I need?",
    answer:
      "For BJJ Gi classes: a Gi and belt. For No-Gi: rashguard/t-shirt and shorts/leggings (no zippers). For Muay Thai/MMA: hand wraps, gloves, shin guards, and a mouthguard is recommended. For Wrestling: athletic apparel; wrestling shoes are optional—if worn, they must be clean and used only on the mats. We have limited loaner gear for first-time visitors (subject to availability) and pro-shop options if you’d like to buy."
  },


  {
    question: "Can I cross-train between programs (BJJ, Muay Thai, MMA, Wrestling)?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many members train both grappling and striking. We’ll help you plan a weekly mix that matches your goals—self-defense, fitness, or competition—and integrate Wrestling takedowns with BJJ/MMA groundwork."
  },

  {
    question: "Do you offer a trial for new students?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Try our classes, meet the coaches, and experience the atmosphere before committing.",

  },

  {
    question: "What should I bring to my first class?",
    answer:
      "A water bottle, comfortable athletic clothing, and (if you have them) basic gear. Arrive 10 minutes early so we can show you around and get you set up."
  },

  {
    question: "Do you prepare students for competition?",
    answer:
      "We support first-time and experienced competitors with structured coaching, sparring/rolling sessions, and game-planning across BJJ, Muay Thai, Wrestling, and MMA. Competing is always optional—many members train for fitness and self-defense only."
  },

  {
    question: "Can I pay less if I only train once or twice a week?",
    answer:
      "Short answer: no. We keep pricing simple and don’t offer reduced rates based on attendance. We’re not set up to track per-week usage for everyone—handling that would create too much overhead and take focus away from coaching."
